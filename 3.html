<p>The <u>Chuck</u> steak is a cut of beef and is part of the sub-prime cut known as the chuck.
  The typical chuck steak is rectangular cut, about 2.54cm (1inch) thick and containing parts of the shoulder bones, and is often known as a "7-bone steak"
  as the shape of the shoulder-bone in cross sectio resembles the numeral '7'.
  This cut is usually grilled or broiled; a thicker version is sold as a "7-bone roast" or "chuck roast" and is usually cooked with liquid as a pot roast.
  <strong><u> The bone-in chuck steak or roast</u></strong> is one of the more economical cuts of beef. In the UK, this part is commonly referred to as "braising steak".
  It is particuarly popular for use as ground beef for its richness of flavor and balance of meat and fat.
