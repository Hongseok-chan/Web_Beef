<h2>Sirloin</h2>
<p>The <u>Sirloin</u> is cut from the sirloin, the subprimal posterior to the short loin where the T-bone, porterhouse, and club steak are cut.
  The sirloin is actually divided inti several types of steak. <strong>The <u>top sirloin</u> is the most prized of these and is specifically marked for sale under that name.</strong>
  The bottom sirloin, which is less tender and much larger, is typically marked for sale simply as "sirloin steak". The bottom sirloin, in turn, connects to the sirloin tip roast.
  In connib British, South African, and Australian butchery, the word sirloin refers to cuts of meat from the upper middle of the animal, sililar to the American short loin, while the American sirloin is called the rump.
  Because of this difference in terminology, in these countries, the T-bone steak is regarded as a cut of the sirloin.</p>
